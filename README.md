# Caesar Cipher â€“ Python Implementation

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This project is a Python program that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.  
It allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption or decryption.

## ðŸ“œ About the Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.  
It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Example with shift = 3:

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Encrypts plaintext with a user-defined shift value
- Decrypts ciphertext back to original text
- Works with **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
- Preserves spaces and non-alphabetic characters

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.x
